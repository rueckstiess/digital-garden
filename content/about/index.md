Born in Munich, Germany and educated in T√ºbingen and Munich, I hold a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the Technical University Munich ([TUM][tum]), with the focus of my [thesis][thesis] at the intersection of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning. My other peer-reviewed publications can be found [here][publications].

I now live in Melbourne, Australia and work remotely for [MongoDB][mongodb] as an ML researcher.

My surname is pronounced [/Ààr èk ÉtiÀês/][pronounce], which for English native speakers sounds a bit like "rick-shtees". It contains two letters that aren't available in the standard latin alphabet: The umlaut "√º" and the "√ü" (sharp s), which can be replaced with "ue" and "ss" respectively. That's why you'll also see my name spelled _Rueckstiess_ at times.
